# Comprehensive outdoor UWB dataset: Static and dynamic measurements in LOS/NLOS environments
This outdoor UWB dataset s designed to support research on **UWB-based localization**. This dataset includes synchronized **UWB/IMU/GNSS** data 
along with RTK-corrected GNSS measurements serving as high-precision reference for evaluating localization performance.
The dataset was collected by ADIP(Applied Dynamics & Intelligent Prognosis)-laboratory at Hanyang Universityâ€™s Engineering Center in South Korea.
